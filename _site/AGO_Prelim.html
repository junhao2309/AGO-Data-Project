<p>From the above, we see entries that are duplicated for whether the amount is similar and whether the agency or suppliers that claims were made under are the same. Due to the categorisation of the claims amount. The value of an awarded amount split into two procurement claim can evade the ITT categorisation checks.These procurement claims should be highlighted as potential fraudulant activities.</p>
